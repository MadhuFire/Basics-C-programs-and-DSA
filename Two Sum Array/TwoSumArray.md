# âž• Two Sum Problem in C

This is a **DSA-level** C program that solves the popular **Two Sum** problem. Given an array of integers, the task is to find the indices of two numbers such that their sum equals a specific target.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## ðŸ§  How it works:
- Iterate through the array using nested loops.
- Check if any two numbers add up to the given target.
- Return their indices (0-based).

## ðŸ“Œ Example:
```c
Input:
Array: [2, 7, 11, 15]
Target: 9

Output:
Indices: 0 and 1
(2 + 7 = 9)
