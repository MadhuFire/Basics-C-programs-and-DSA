# 👋 Hi, I'm Madhu Kumaran

🎓 I'm a student from **Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India**, and I'm going to start my college journey in **Kalingar Karunanithi Institute of Technology (KIT)** in 4 months.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **C programming**.

Here, I will be uploading:
- Basic C programs (like Fibonacci, Palindrome, etc.)
- DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice in C
- My personal notes and learning experiments
- A command-line game made using only C (no graphics)

> This is my way of tracking my progress and becoming better step by step.
